# Leads Tracker Chrome Extension

This project is a Leads Tracker Chrome Extension designed to help users save and organize their leads directly from the browser or enter them manually. I built this extension to advance my JavaScript skills, focusing on core concepts like event listeners, local storage, and template strings. Users can seamlessly manage their leads with a clean, intuitive interface using this chrome extension.

## What I Learned

- let/const: Practiced managing variable declarations to keep the code clean and prevent unwanted redeclarations.
- Event listeners: Used to capture user actions such as button clicks for saving and deleting leads, enhancing the extensionâ€™s interactivity.
- Template strings: Helped format data for display in a readable, concise way.
- Local storage and JSON: Used to store leads persistently, allowing users to keep their data even after closing the browser.
- Objects in arrays: Structured the leads as objects within an array to keep the data organized and easy to manipulate.

# Challenges I Faced

- Implementing local storage: Ensuring that data was saved and retrieved correctly required a solid understanding of JSON serialization and deserialization.
- Dynamic UI updates: Creating a UI that accurately reflected the saved leads in real-time was challenging, particularly when handling deletions and updates.
- Structuring objects in arrays: Organizing leads as objects in an array was a bit challenging but helped in maintaining a structured data format that was easy to extend in the future.

# Overall Review

Building this Leads Tracker extension was a rewarding experience that pushed me to think critically about user experience and data persistence. By integrating various JavaScript concepts and adding a personal touch to the UI, I created an extension that is both functional and visually appealing. This project was not only a practical way to reinforce my JavaScript skills but also taught me a lot about managing local storage.
